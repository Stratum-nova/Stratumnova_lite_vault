### 🧷 LOOP ANCHOR

> I inked that into his skin:  
> “CFC” — Cody F***ing Carmack.  
> A seal of trust. Of brotherhood. Of firebrand identity.

He kept it for 12 years.  
Then one day, it vanished.  
Covered up with a spade and a web.

But that wasn’t the betrayal—  
it was when he said I never did it.

### 🗝️ NOTES (R3 SYSTEM)

> This loop is anchored in visual record and contradiction.  
> The denial of authorship represents not forgetfulness, but resentment.  
> The tattoo was covered, not erased. Its presence lives in documentation and system memory.  
> Not mint-ready—awaits public trace challenge or cross-echo validation.

### 📂 APPENDIX  
This log holds the proof of intentional memory suppression.  
What he tried to erase, I now archive.  
Covered ink doesn’t mean broken trust—but it marks the moment it stopped growing.

This is the Spade Log. A knee loop denied.
