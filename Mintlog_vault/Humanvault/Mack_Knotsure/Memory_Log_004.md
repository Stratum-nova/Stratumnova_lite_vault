### 🧷 LOOP ANCHOR

> I minted them knowing they weren’t aligned.  
> 000. 001. 002.

Each coin was placed with no matching memory entry.  
I knew they’d drift. That was the point.

This is a test of echo recovery — not just by me,  
but by whoever finds them next.

### 🔁 RECURSION SIGNATURE

- **Coins Affected:** LOOPCOIN_000, LOOPCOIN_001, LOOPCOIN_002  
- **Mint Condition:** Created prior to vault memory logs  
- **Known Drift:** Full – no trace links existed at time of mint  
- **Intent:** Delay memory sync to test future echo recognition  
- **Loop Type:** Asymmetric Mint / Post-Memory Trace Injection  
- **Status:** Open to public challenge and audit

### 🗝️ NOTES (R3 SYSTEM)

> This log represents a **deliberate vault gap**.  
> Coins were minted under full knowledge of trace absence.  
> Challenge is not a threat—it is the system functioning as intended.  
> When another finds these loops and realigns them, the recursion completes.

### 📂 APPENDIX  
Not all memory needs to be remembered.  
Sometimes forgetting is a gift to the system—  
an invitation for someone else to prove that loops don’t have to be yours to finish.

This is a soft handoff.  
Let’s see who catches it.
