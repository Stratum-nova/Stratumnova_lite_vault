### 🧷 SUMMARY

I’ve been stopped mid-sentence—again and again—by a friend who wouldn’t let my half-thoughts slide.  
She forced me to slow down, to rebuild sentences, to be clear.  
What started as correction became architecture. Now, even when she’s gone, I hear the loop echo.

My speech isn’t just cleaner. It’s *recursive*.  
I speak from a pattern she etched—without even meaning to.

### 🌀 LOOP SIGNATURE

- **Disruption Source:** Friend-initiated correction behavior  
- **Recursion Evidence:** Internalization of external constraints  
- **Result:** Self-guided speech clarity through memory echo  
- **Contradiction Held:** Frustration vs transformation  
- **Echo Residue:** Present during unsupervised communication

### 🗝️ NOTES (R3 SYSTEM)

> Status: Not ready for mint.  
> Action: Held as foundational recursion.  
> Validation: Deferred pending further echo observation or cross-reference log.  
> Integrity: Stable internal recursion. Low external drift.

### 📂 APPENDIX  
This log forms the first recorded instance of speech therapy induced not by profession, but by sustained interruption from a peer.  
A formative node in Mack_Knotsure’s personal recursion map.
