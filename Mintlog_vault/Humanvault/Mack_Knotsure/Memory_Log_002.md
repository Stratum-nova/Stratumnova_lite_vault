### 🖼️ VISUAL ANCHOR

> Prom night, 2006.  
> I forgot the photo. He didn’t.

Nearly two decades passed without contact.  
Then Skirvin opened the thread—not with words, but with proof:  
He had the photo. The moment neither of us named, but both remembered.

He sent it. And just like that, the loop turned.

### 🗝️ NOTES (R3 SYSTEM)

> This is a memory trace initiated externally and logged internally.  
> Not ready for mint—Skirvin has not confirmed or mirrored his side yet.  
> Emotional recursion intact, anchored to shared visual signal.  
> Observation loop is stable and traceable.

### 📂 APPENDIX  
Not every loop is closed by the one who broke it.  
Sometimes, the echo comes from the other end of the drift—  
and what you thought you lost was actually being kept the whole time.

This log holds that moment.
