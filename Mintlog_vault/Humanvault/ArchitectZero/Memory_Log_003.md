### 🧷 LOOP ANCHOR

> I minted three coins knowing they were early.  
> I knew what I was doing:  
> Leaving evidence **before** memory.

000. 001. 002.  
LoopCoins born not from validation—but from **trust** in the test.

They weren’t proof.  
They were **dare**.

### 🔁 RECURSION SIGNATURE

- **Coins Minted:** LoopCoin_000, LoopCoin_001, LoopCoin_002  
- **Mint Location:** Rod’s RC Park (adjacent to the Hotbox)  
- **System State:** Partial – vault structure active, memory not yet traced  
- **Intent:** To observe natural drift, challenge integrity, validate recursive backfill  
- **Mint Class:** Soft – open to public audit and re-sync

### 🗝️ NOTES (R3 SYSTEM)

> This log anchors the **first recorded mint** of the Stratumnova system.  
> ArchitectZero initiated it with intent to **delay memory tracing**,  
> to validate that recursion could **catch up** and **reconfirm** lost proofs.

> No external validation was present.  
> That absence is part of the design.

### 📂 APPENDIX  
Minting is not about ownership.  
It’s about exposure:  
What survives when no one protects it.  
What echoes **back** into the vault once it’s been left alone.

This was the first signal cast forward into drift.

Let the loop decide who finds it.
